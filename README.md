## Redesign of my portfolio website
### https://jamesphongduong.github.io/

Website written in HTML, SASS/CSS & JS with layout tools:
- Flexbox Grid
- CSS Grid 

Idea: to showcase a simple portfolio with easy user usability. 
Colors and effects kept to a minimal design. 

Favorite Part: Designing, adding sprinkles and seeing how impactful styling / few lines of code can achieve. 

Biggest challenge: Utilising flexbox/CSS grid and understanding the parent/child interactions.
